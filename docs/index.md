## WORK EXPERIENCE

**BioSensics LLC,** Newton, MA Jan. 2020 – Present<br>
Machine Learning Engineer & Backend Engineer

* Project: An AWS-based online service aimed for bone fracture risk analysis &amp; detecting fracture prone areas using 
computer vision. A 3D UNET-basedneural network was developed for localizing &amp; segmenting femur bone in CT images 
with 97% dice score. (Python, TensorFlow, Keras, AWS, BitBucket Pipeline, unittest)
    * Coordinated effectively within the design team as the link between developers &amp; scientists.
    * Used AWS tools, e.g. S3, Step Functions, EC2, CodeDeploy to orchestrate backend workflow.
    * Automized testing &amp; deployment using Docker, BitBucket Pipeline &amp; AWS CodeDeploy (deployment on EC2 instances).
    * Developed back end modules deployed to collect &amp; process patient data &amp; obtain analysis results in an end-to-end fashion. Processing performed on AWS EC2 GPU instances to increase efficiency &amp; decrease computation time.
    * Wrote &amp; maintained performance tests for ensuring end-to-end functionality, improving efficiency &amp; general debugging.
    * Refactored &amp; documented modules to improve readability &amp; time/memory efficiency so it can be deployed on AWS.

* Developed a custom 2D/3D Spatial RNN layer using TF &amp; Keras &amp; incorporated into UNET model which improved the object detection accuracy significantly. The model facilitated challenges due to low contrast, &amp; complex anatomy shapes. (GitHub)
* Developed a highly sophisticated neural network using convolutional, dropout &amp; LSTM layers for detecting &amp; evaluating severity of Parkinson&#39;s Disease with an accuracy of 90%.
* Maintained technical knowledge by reviewing &amp; implementing states-of-the-art DNN publications &amp; repos on a daily basis.
* Collaborated in preparation &amp; publication of technical papers on cutting-edge ML-based solutions.

**Northeastern University (GRAIL Research Lab),** Boston, MA Sept. 2018 – Dec.2019

Research Assistant

* Thesis (Python, PyTorch, ROS, Gazebo, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)

    - A policy for navigating using incorrect/incomplete abstract maps based on capitalizing on given data regarding environment.
    - Built novel neural network models for training the navigation agent using PyTorch &amp; ResNet50. The model performs image analysis &amp; barrier recognition, scores possible navigation commands choosing the safest &amp; fastest toward target.
    - Designed, developed &amp; maintained a complex project consist of several scripts developed using various languages.
    - Adopted new open source tools &amp; projects for agent&#39;s image processing, decision making and data collection/storage.
